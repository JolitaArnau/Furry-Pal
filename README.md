# Furry-Pal

Furry Pal is a web application, which is being developed for educational purposes, which is being developed during the second part of the C# Web Development Module at SoftUni and will be presented to a jury on Janury 10. The main idea behind it: the platform aims to provide its customers with a nice virtual experience for shopping dog supplies online. It offers products such as dog food, treats, toys, beds, food bowls, collars and leashes. Furry Pal will support reordering previous orders with one simple click. In other words - its users will never have to worry about forgetting to buy their pet’s food again. Upon ordering, registered users will have the opportunity to choose whether they would like to have their dog’s food (or any other product) re-ordered and delivered at regular intervals. That for they will receive a 5% discount on scheduled every order.

Note: Until now users can purchase products in an one-time order and add products to their order subscription, to be delivered again in 31 days.
